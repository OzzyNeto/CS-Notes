*** Configure the OS/161 Kernel
- The kernel sources for OS/161 are found at =~/src/os161/kern/=.
- The configuration sources are found at =/kern/conf/=.
  + A configuration script _config_.
  + A base configuration file _conf.kern_. This file determines what source files get included in your kernel build, so if you add sources to the kernel youâ€™ll need to add them to conf.kern as well.
  + Example configurations (GENERIC, DUMBVM, etc).
- To configure a kernel with one of the configurations, simply run =./config <configuration>=
*** Build the OS/161 Kernel
- After configuring the kernel, we should have a directory in which to build it.
- This directory is at =~/src/os161/compile/<conf_name>=.
- Three steps to build a kernel:
  1) Building the dependencies (bmake depend)
  2) Building the kernel (bmake)
  3) Installing the kernel (bmake install)
- We use bmake instead of make because OS/161 sources use BSD make.
- If these commands run successfully, we should have a new kernel in the =~/root/= directory.
*** Configuring sys161
- OS/161 kernels are built to be run by a special-purpose simulator called sys161, or System/161.
- We are not expected to modify sys161 but we do have to configure it by specifying the number of CPU cores, the amount of memory, and the number of disk drives.
  + This can be modified in the =~/root/sys161.conf= file.
*** Running a Kernel
- To run the kernel we just built, run the command: =sys161 kernel=
