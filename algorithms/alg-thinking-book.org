** Problem 1: Unique Snowflakes
*** Reading the Input
- We make the snowflakes array a _static_ array.
- The static keyword places the array in its own, separate piece of memory, where space is not a concern.
  + This is good to do for huge arrays.
- Note that static local variables are only initialized once.
*** Diagnosing the Problem
- We can think of today's computers as being able to perform 30 million steps per second.
  + This is a conservatice estimate.
*** Sorting Snowflakes
