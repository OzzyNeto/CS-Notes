#+TITLE: Arch Linux Notes

* Arch Linux Installation
** Wifi
*** Networking Types
- Wired or Wireless
  - Wired is usually straightforward to set up.
  - Wireless: different security solutions.
- Fix or Dynamic IP
  - Dynamic IP gets an automatic address from a DHCP server (needs DHCP client running).
  - Fix IP: the user needs to set it up.
*** Wired Network
- Use "ip link" command to list all network interfaces.
  - In case of a wired connection, possibly DHCP client is running already and therefore has an IP (check if this is the case in systemd by running "systemctl list-units | grep dhcp").
  - You can start it by running "systemctl start dhcpcd@interface". The "interface" in the command can be found using the "ip link" command.
- Check the adapter properties using the "ip address" command.
  - You can check the connection with the "ping" command.
  - To find acutual IP addresses look for the "inet" row in the command output.
*** Wireless Network
- NOTE: In July 2020, the Arch Installer removed netctl and wifi-menu.
- To install Arch Linux using a wifi connection, you should now use the *iwctl* command. Simply type out =iwctl= in the terminal to start the "iwd" prompt.
- Step 1: Find the name of your wireless adapter
  + Command: _device list_
- Step 2: Scan the available wireless networks
  + Command: _station <wireless_adapter_name> scan_
  + NOTE: wireless_adapter_name is the name found in Step 1
  + This command starts scanning but doesn't output the names of the available networks, for that, go to Step 3.
- Step 3: Find the name of your network
  + Command: _station <wireless_adapter_name> get-networks_
- Step 4: Connect to the Network
  + Command: _station <wireless_adapter_name> connect <network_name>_
- Step 5: Enter password and "exit" the iwd prompt
*** Regarding Issues with iwd
- If your wireless device is not powered on, run the command =rfkill unblock wlan=.
- To make sure the device is unblocked, you can run =rfkill list all=
*** Install the iwd Package While arch-chroot's in the System
- Make sure to run =pacman -S iwd= while you're arch-chroot'd into the new system.
- Also make sure to enable the iwd service with =systemctl enable iwd.service=
- If you don't do this, you won't be able to connect to your wifi network after rebooting the system.
*** Configure iwd
- Setup DNS capabilities using the built-in _systemd-resolved_ package with =systemctl enable systemd-resolved.service=
- Add the following lines to the _/etc/iwd/main.conf_ file:
#+begin_src text
[General]
EnableNetworkConfiguration=true

[Network]
NameResolvingService=systemd
#+end_src

* Arch Linux Maintenance
** Failed systemd Services
- Command to check for failed services:
  + *systemctl --failed*
- Command to Check Lock Files:
  + *sudo journalctl -p 3 -xb*
** Update the System Regularly
- Command to use yay to update packages from BOTH main repos and AUR
  + *yay -Syu*
** Check the pacman Cache
- The _pacman cache_ is the cache where packages are STORED whether or not they were installed.
- Command to delete cached packages that are NOT currently installed in the system:
  + *sudo pacman -Sc*
  + For the AUR: *yay -Sc*
- Command to delete ALL packages that are in the cache regardless of whether they're installed or not
  + *sudo pacman -Scc*
  + *yay -Scc*
** Removing Unwanted Dependencies
- *yay -Yc*
** Removing Orphan (Unused) Packages
- Command to check if there are orphan packages in the system:
  + *pacman -Qtdq*
- Command to delete all orphan packages in the system
  + *sudo pacman -Rns $(pacman -Qtdq)*
** Cleaning Up Directories That Might be Taking Up Space
*** ~/.cache/
- We can use the _du (disk usage)_ command to check how much space a directory is taking up.
- Command to check how much space our home .cache diretcory is taking up:
  + *du -sh ~/.cache/*
  + -s: Summarize
  + -h: Human-Readable
- Delete the CONTENTS of the .cache directory:
  + *rm -rf ~/.cache/**
*** ~/.config
- If this directory is getting bloated, delete any configuration folders that you don't need.
*** /var/log/journal
- Contains logs that can be useful if you need to troubleshoot your machine.
- But if you don't clean it up regularly, it can take up a lot of space.
- Command to clean up the journal directory in such a way that only the logs from the past 2 weeks remain:
  + *sudo journalctl --vacuum-time=2weeks*
** Refreshing the mirrorlist
- reflector command to refresh your mirrorlist:
  + *sudo reflector -c 'United States' -a 6 --sort rate --save /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist*

* What is UEFI and How to Use It
- How to know if you're booted in UEFI
  - RUN COMMAND: ls /sys/firmware/efi/efivars
  - If ls returns stuff, you're in UEFI

* youtube-dl
** Basic Downloading
- *youtube-dl <URL>*
  + This places the downloaded video in your current working directory.
- Listing Available Formats
  + *youtube-dl -F <URL>*
    - This hunts down the video and lists all of the available formats (and their format codes) that you could specify for downloading it.
- Downloading With a Specific Format
  + *youtube-dl -f <FORMAT_CODE> <URL>*
- Downloading Playlists
  + *youtube-dl <PLAYLIST_URL>*
- Downloading an ENTIRE CHANNEL
  + *youtube-dl <CHANNEL_URL>*
